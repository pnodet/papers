# DMT-induced shifts in criticality correlate with self-dissolution

### Problem / State of the Art

Do psychedelics push the brain _toward_ or _away from_ critical dynamics (the “edge of chaos” regime thought to support rich information processing)? Prior work showed psychedelics increase global entropy, but the link between that and **criticality**—especially frequency-specific and tied to subjective experience—has been unclear.

### Goal

Test how intravenous DMT alters markers of near-critical brain dynamics in humans (EEG), identify the **direction** of any shift (subcritical vs supercritical), and relate those shifts to core subjective effects—especially self/ego-dissolution.

### Challenges

- Criticality is tricky to infer in noisy, nonstationary EEG data; most markers (e.g., DFA) don’t reveal _direction_ of deviation from criticality.
- Psychedelic effects unfold across frequencies and time, and mapping them to specific experiential facets (like self-dissolution) requires careful behavioral linkage.

### Key Mechanism / Methods

- **Signals & setup.** 27 healthy adults from two placebo-controlled studies; 31-channel EEG at baseline and ~20 min post-IV DMT (7–20 mg fumarate). Subjective ratings collected post-session, with items targeting self/time/space/cognition and global intensity.
- **Criticality marker.** Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) on band-limited amplitude envelopes (theta 4–8 Hz, alpha 8–13 Hz, beta 13–30 Hz). DFA≈1 → near-critical (pink-noise-like); DFA≈0.5 → far from critical (white-noise-like).
- **Directionality marker.** Functional Excitatory/Inhibitory ratio (**fE/I**): sliding-window co-variation between amplitude and temporal structure; positive/zero/negative amplitude–DFA covariance implies subcritical/critical/supercritical, computed only when LRTC>0.6.
- **Stats.** Paired t-tests (DMT vs placebo), FDR correction; Pearson correlations with subjective items.

### Key Results

- **Shift away from criticality.** DFA decreased under DMT: theta Δ=−0.06 (p<.0001), alpha Δ=−0.09 (p<.0001), beta Δ=−0.06 (p=.0004). Spatially widespread (see topographical maps on _page 14_, left column). Lower DFA ⇒ **less complex, more entropic**, more white-noise-like dynamics.
- **Direction = subcritical.** fE/I decreased in **alpha** (Δ=−0.18, p=.0003; parietal/occipital) and **left-occipital beta** (Δ=−0.14, p=.0005), consistent with a **move toward subcritical regimes** (see _page 14_, right column).
- **Links to experience.** Larger DFA _reductions_ correlated with stronger **self-dissolution** ratings: theta r=−0.61 (p=.001), alpha r=−0.56 (p=.005). Correlations are broad across electrodes (see _page 15_).
- **Visuals.** Example traces and DFA/fE-I logic are illustrated on _page 13_; scalp maps and boxplots on _page 14_; correlation maps/scatter on _page 15_.

### Strengths

- **Frequency-resolved** and **direction-aware** analysis (DFA + fE/I) goes beyond prior “global entropy” stories.
- **Behavioral linkage:** robust correlation of criticality shifts with a hallmark psychedelic phenomenon (self-dissolution).
- **Method clarity:** careful explanation of entropy–complexity–criticality relationships prevents common misreadings.

### Improvements

- **Temporal alignment:** effects are averaged over minutes; tighter neurophenomenology (time-locked reports or continuous ratings) could sharpen state–signal mapping.
- **High-gamma access:** authors speculate supercritical dynamics might reside in >40 Hz; the current setup can’t test this.
- **Subjective construct clarity:** “disintegration of self” isn’t disambiguated across participants; brief qualitative anchors could reduce interpretive variance.
- **Generality:** modest N and single compound/dose range; replication with other psychedelics/doses and multimodal markers (MEG/ECoG) would test robustness.

### What I Learned / Liked

- The **direction** of deviation from criticality matters: DMT can raise _entropy_ in alpha/theta while still pushing networks **away** from criticality—**toward subcritical, less complex dynamics**—and that specifically tracks **self-dissolution**. It’s a neat, frequency-specific refinement to “entropic brain” thinking.

### Summary Brief

In placebo-controlled EEG, IV DMT reduced DFA in theta/alpha/beta—indicating a move **away from near-critical dynamics** toward **more entropic, less complex (white-noise-like)** activity. Using fE/I, these shifts point **toward subcritical regimes**, most clearly in parietal/occipital **alpha** (and left-occipital **beta**). Crucially, the magnitude of DFA reduction in **theta/alpha** correlates with **self-dissolution** intensity. Together, the data argue that DMT perturbs alpha-centric systems supporting temporally extended, self-referential processing, and that psychedelic “entropy” can coexist with **subcritical** dynamics in specific bands—likely alongside different (possibly supercritical) behavior at higher frequencies not measured here. See figures on _pages 13–15_ for representative traces, scalp maps, and correlations.

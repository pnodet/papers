# Characterising transport in a quantum gas by measuring Drude weights

[arxiv.org/2406.17569](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17569)

## Problem / State of the Art

The paper studies **transport in quantum many-body systems**, focusing on **Drude weights** as fundamental transport coefficients that distinguish ballistic (dissipationless) from diffusive transport. In condensed matter, Drude weights are central to classifying **insulators vs. metals vs. superconductors**, and are often discussed in terms of charge stiffness and current–current correlations.

In **integrable 1D systems**, transport is strongly constrained by infinitely many conservation laws, leading to **ballistic quasi-particle propagation** even at finite temperature. Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD) has given exact predictions for such transport and for Drude weights in models like the Lieb–Liniger Bose gas and XXZ spin chains. However:

- Most evidence so far has been **indirect** (density profiles, expansion dynamics).
- There had been **no direct experimental measurement of Drude weights** in an interacting quantum gas.

This paper fills that experimental gap for a **1D weakly interacting Bose gas** described by the Lieb–Liniger model, realized with ultracold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms on an atom chip.

## Goal

The main objectives are:

1. **Directly measure the Drude weights** $D_{nn}$ and $D_{n\varepsilon}$ of a 1D Bose gas:
   - $D_{nn}$: response of particle current to a potential coupled to density.
   - $D_{n\varepsilon}$: response of _energy_ current to the same perturbation.

2. **Test quantitative predictions of GHD** and hydrodynamic Drude-weight theory for the Lieb–Liniger gas at finite temperature.

3. **Demonstrate experimental protocols** that can be adapted to other quantum and condensed matter systems to access transport coefficients.

## Challenges

Why is this hard?

- **Experimental access to Drude weights**
  The standard Kubo definition involves time-averaged **current–current autocorrelation functions**:

  ```math
  D_{ab} = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{\beta}{2t}
    \int dz \int_0^t dt' \,\langle j_a(z,t') j_b(0,0)\rangle_c
  ```

  Directly measuring these correlators is extremely challenging with destructive absorption imaging.

- **Separating ballistic vs diffusive transport**
  In generic systems, Drude weights coexist with diffusive contributions. For quasi-condensates, diffusion is expected to be negligible on experimental timescales, but this must be justified and checked.

- **Finite systems & boundary effects**
  The gas is confined in a box of length $L\sim 100\,\mu\text{m}$, so reflections from hard walls limit the time window where bulk hydrodynamics (and asymptotic definitions of Drude weights) apply.

- **Imperfect potentials and disorder**

  The DMD-generated optical potentials have systematic imperfections and residual disorder, which can reduce effective conductivity and complicate comparison with ideal GHD predictions.

- **Inferring currents from density only**
  Experiments measure **density profiles** (n(z,t)), not currents. Extracting both particle and energy currents requires either:
  - Numerical differentiation (noisy, unstable), or
  - A more sophisticated inversion scheme that imposes conservation laws.

## Key Mechanism

The authors use **two complementary experimental protocols**, both inspired by hydrodynamic definitions of Drude weights:

### 1. Constant-Force Protocol (Linear Potential)

- **Setup**: Start from a homogeneous gas in a flat box potential (Fig. 1b on page 2). At $t=0$, tilt the potential:
  $$
  V(z) = \phi_n z
  $$
  analogous to a constant electric field acting on charge carriers.

- **Observable**: Measure atom number imbalance:
  $$
  \Delta N(t) = N_L(t) - N_R(t)
  $$
  then the local particle current at the center is
  $$
  j_n(z=0,t) = \tfrac12 \frac{d}{dt}\Delta N(t)
  $$
  approximated experimentally by $\Delta N/t$ at late times.

- **Drude weight from long-time current growth**
  Using the hydrodynamic definition:

  ```math
  D_{ab} = \lim_{\phi_a\to 0} \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{j_b(z,t)}{t\,\phi_a}
  ```

  they extract:
  - $D_{nn}$ from particle current vs potential gradient,
  - $D_{n\varepsilon}$ from energy current using $j_\varepsilon = g_{1D}\, n\, j_n$ (interaction-dominated energy).

### 2. Bipartition Protocol (Domain-Wall Initial State)

- **Setup**: Prepare a step-like chemical potential:
  $$
  V(z) = \delta\mu\,\Theta(z)
  $$
  so left and right halves have different densities (Fig. 1c, page 2). At $t=0$, quench to a flat potential → two counter-propagating waves emerge.

- **GHD perspective**: After some time, the state becomes **self-similar** along rays $\xi = z/t$. There is a quasi-stationary current profile $j_b(\xi)$. The Drude weight can be expressed as:

  ```math
  D_{nb} = \lim_{\delta\mu\to 0} \frac{1}{2\delta\mu}
            \int d\xi\, j_b(\xi)
  ```

  which connects the _integrated asymptotic current profile_ to the Drude weight.

- **Inferring currents via PINN**
  Since only (n(z,t)) is measured, the authors use a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)**:
  - Inputs: coordinates ((z,t)).

  - Outputs: $n(z,t)$, $j_n(z,t)$, $j_\varepsilon(z,t)$.

  - Physics constraints: continuity equations

    ```math
    \partial_t n + \partial_z j_n = 0, \quad
    \partial_t \varepsilon + \partial_z j_\varepsilon = 0,
    ```

    with $\varepsilon \approx \tfrac12 g_{1D} n^2$.

  - Loss function combines:
    - MSE to measured density,
    - MSE on continuity residuals,
    - Boundary conditions (currents vanish at the box edges).

  The schematic on **page 3, Fig. 3a** shows this architecture: NN block for fields + PDE block for continuity equations. The resulting current profiles and self-similar $\xi$-dependence are compared to GHD simulations using the iFluid framework (panels b–g).

### 3. Theoretical Drude Weights from GHD

On the theory side, they use **hydrodynamic projections** in the Lieb–Liniger model to compute Drude weights:

- Quasi-particle rapidity distribution $\rho_p(\theta)$ and occupation $\vartheta(\theta)$ from Yang–Yang thermodynamics.
- GHD expression:

  ```math
  D_{ab} = \beta \int d\theta\,
    \rho_p(\theta)\bigl(1 - \vartheta(\theta)\bigr)\,
    v_\text{eff}(\theta)^2\, h_a^{\text{dr}}(\theta) h_b^{\text{dr}}(\theta)
  ```

  where $h_a^{\text{dr}}$ are dressed one-particle eigenvalues, and $v_{\text{eff}}$ is the dressed group velocity.

They also estimate that diffusive contributions (Onsager matrix $L_{ab}$) are negligible in the quasi-condensate regime, with crossover times $t^\star\sim 10^{-40}\,\text{s}$, many orders of magnitude below experimental timescales.

## Key Results

### 1. Drude Weights from Both Protocols Match GHD

The main plots are **Fig. 4 (page 4)** and **Fig. 6 (page 8)**:

- **Measured vs theoretical $D_{nn}$** (particle current response):
  - Scales approximately as
    $$
    D_{nn} \propto \frac{\bar{n}}{m}
    $$
    consistent with the idea that Drude weight is “density of mobile carriers / mass,” even in an interacting finite-temperature gas.
  - Very good quantitative agreement between:
    - Drude weights extracted from **constant-force** protocol,
    - Those from **bipartition + PINN**,
    - **GHD theory** at $T=50\,\text{nK}$.

- **Measured vs theoretical $D_{n\varepsilon}$** (energy current response):
  - Agreement with GHD predictions despite only measuring interaction energy currents (not full energy).
  - At low density, interaction energy scales $\sim \bar{n}^2$; at higher density, $g_{1D}$ becomes density-dependent and energy becomes more linear in $\bar{n}$. This is reflected in the curvature of $D_{n\varepsilon}(\bar{n})$.

### 2. Transport is Essentially Fully Ballistic

- Diffusive corrections are estimated to be totally negligible on experimental timescales, justifying the use of **Drude weights alone** to characterize transport.
- The observed currents grow linearly in time under constant force and settle into clean self-similar profiles in the bipartition protocol, both signatures of ballistic quasi-particle transport.

### 3. Temperature & Linearity Checks

- Residuals $R_{nn} = (D^{\text{meas}}_{nn} - D^{\text{theory}}_{nn}) m$ are plotted vs **temperature** and **perturbation strength $\delta\mu$** in Fig. 4c–d.
  - No systematic dependence on $T$ in the 10–50 nK range.
  - No dependence on perturbation amplitude, confirming **linear response** despite finite quenches.

### 4. Systematic Offset Attributed to Optical Imperfections

- Measured Drude weights are **slightly lower** than theory.
- Authors attribute this to **imperfections in the DMD potentials**, which:
  - Introduce density inhomogeneities in initial states,
  - Add effective disorder to the flat box,
  - Reduce effective conductivity.

## Strengths

- **Direct, quantitative measurement of Drude weights** in an interacting quantum gas — this is a major conceptual and technical step.
- **Two independent protocols** (constant force & bipartition) that:
  - Probe the same transport coefficients,
  - Produce consistent results,
  - Provide strong internal cross-checks.

- **Elegant combination of experiment + GHD + PINNs**:
  - GHD gives first-principles Drude weights and full dynamics.
  - PINNs provide a clever way to reconstruct currents from density data while enforcing conservation laws, improving robustness over naive finite differences.

- **Clear hydrodynamic framing**:
  - The paper connects Kubo/formal definitions, hydrodynamic projections, and operational experimental definitions (current vs time & ray-integrated currents).

- **Experimental platform is clean and flexible**:
  - 1D Lieb–Liniger gas with tunable potentials via DMD.
  - Good control of temperature, density, and geometry.

## Improvements / Limitations

Some reasonable caveats and possible extensions:

1. **Limited exploration of integrability breaking**
   - The system is “approximately integrable,” but effects of integrability breaking (e.g. transverse excitations, density-dependent coupling) are only argued to be weak; they’re not systematically varied to see the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport.

2. **Energy current only via interaction term**
   - They approximate energy density as interaction energy $\varepsilon \approx \tfrac12 g_{1D} n^2$, valid in the quasi-condensate regime.
   - Extension to regimes where kinetic/thermal contributions are important would require including momentum continuity and pressure in the PINN (as they mention in Appendix C).

3. **Reliance on PINN modeling choices**
   - Though PINNs are powerful, the current reconstruction depends on:
     - Network architecture,
     - Smoothing of data,
     - Regularization choices.

   - There’s some validation against GHD, but a more systematic error quantification of the PINN inference itself could strengthen the conclusions.

4. **Residual discrepancy not fully quantified**
   - The underestimation of Drude weights is attributed to DMD imperfection/disorder. It would be nice to:
     - Directly characterize this disorder,
     - Include it in GHD (or beyond-GHD) simulations to see if it quantitatively explains the offset.

5. **Regime specificity**
   - Experiments are restricted to:
     - Weakly interacting, quasi-condensate regime ($\gamma \approx 0.002$),
     - Low T.

   - Exploring stronger interactions or higher temperatures could test more nontrivial parts of GHD (e.g. more complex dressing, stronger thermal effects).

## What I Learned / Liked

- **Operational meaning of Drude weight in cold atoms**:
  This paper makes the definition of Drude weight very concrete:
  - Linear growth rate of current under constant force,
  - Ray-integrated current in bipartition setups.

- **PINNs as a bridge between sparse data and hydrodynamics**:
  - Using conservation laws explicitly in the loss function is a neat way to upgrade noisy density movies into reliable current fields.

- **How simple the scaling can be** in an interacting integrable model:
  - The proportionality $D_{nn} \sim \bar{n}/m$ looks deceptively “free-particle-like”, but emerges from nontrivial dressed quasi-particle structure and uniform coupling of the external potential.

- **Experimental viability of GHD transport coefficients**:
  - GHD is not just qualitatively right; here it produces accurate numerical predictions for Drude weights that match experiment within systematic errors.

## Summary Brief of the Paper

The authors realize a 1D weakly interacting Bose gas of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms on an atom chip and use it to **directly measure Drude weights** characterizing ballistic transport of particles and energy. They implement two protocols: (i) applying a constant linear potential and extracting Drude weights from the **linear growth of current**, and (ii) a **bipartition quench** from a density step, where **self-similar currents** along rays $\xi=z/t$ are reconstructed using physics-informed neural networks constrained by continuity equations.

Across both protocols and a range of densities and temperatures, they find **excellent agreement** with **Generalized Hydrodynamics** predictions for the Lieb–Liniger model, including the expected scaling $D_{nn}\propto \bar{n}/m$. Transport is shown to be almost fully ballistic, with diffusive effects negligible on experimental timescales. Slight systematic underestimation of the Drude weights is attributed to imperfections in the optical potentials. Overall, the work provides a **quantitative experimental confirmation** of hydrodynamic Drude-weight theory in an integrable quantum gas and offers **general protocols** for measuring transport coefficients in other strongly correlated systems.

# Curved representational Bregman divergences and their applications

[arxiv.org/2504.05654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05654)

### Problem / State of the Art

Bregman divergences underpin tons of geometry-flavored tools (centroids, projections, Voronoi, etc.). Existing theory is rich for **full** parameter spaces, and for **curved exponential families** on the statistical side, but there hasn’t been a clean, general formulation of “Bregman geometry restricted to nonlinear parameter submanifolds,” nor a unifying take that ties α-divergences to Bregman tools in a way that yields practical algorithms.

### Goal

1. Define **curved Bregman divergences**: Bregman divergences restricted to nonlinear parameter subspaces $U\subset\Theta$. 2) Characterize their barycenters via Bregman projection. 3) Introduce **representational** curved Bregman divergences via a diffeomorphic reparametrization $R$. 4) Show that **α-divergences** are representational curved Bregmans and leverage this to compute intersections of α-divergence spheres efficiently.

### Challenges

- Working on **nonlinear submanifolds** breaks many linear tricks; you need a projection principle that still behaves nicely.
- Tying **α-divergences** to Bregman geometry requires a careful representation and duality story so that computational geometry tools (spheres, intersections) carry over.
- Handling examples beyond the classic real Gaussian case (e.g., **circular complex normals**) without losing the exponential-family/Bregman link.

### Key Mechanism (Core Ideas)

- **Definition (Curved Bregman divergence).** For $U=\{\theta(u)\}\subset\Theta$, define
  $B_F(u_1:u_2) = F(\theta(u_1)) - F(\theta(u_2)) - \langle \theta(u_1)-\theta(u_2), \nabla F(\theta(u_2))\rangle$. This is just the ordinary $B_F$ restricted to the submanifold $U$.
- **Projection principle (Theorem 1).** The **curved Bregman centroid** of weighted points on $U$ equals the **right Bregman projection of the unconstrained Bregman centroid** $\bar\theta=\sum_i w_i\theta_i$ onto $U$:
  $\arg\min_{u\in U}\sum_i w_i B_F(\theta_i:\theta(u)) = \arg\min_{u\in U} B_F(\bar\theta:\theta(u))$. (Not necessarily unique if the projection isn’t.)
- **Examples.**
  • **Symmetrized Bregman (Jeffreys–Bregman)** becomes a curved Bregman on the embedded manifold $\xi(\theta)=(\theta,\nabla F(\theta))$ with generator $F_{\xi}(\theta)=F(\theta)+F^*(\nabla F(\theta))$.
  • **KLD between circular complex normals** reduces to a reverse Bregman between natural parameters of an associated (2d)-variate real Gaussian, exhibiting a curved exponential-family structure.
- **Representational curved Bregmans.** With a diffeomorphism $R$, define $B_F(R(\theta_1):R(\theta_2))$. The paper proves **α-divergences** are representational curved Bregmans via explicit potentials $F_\alpha$ and representation maps $R_\alpha$ (and their duals), and also as **representational Fenchel–Young** divergences.
- **Epigraph lifting for spheres.** Right/left Bregman spheres correspond to intersections/“illuminations” of hyperplanes with the epigraph of (F). Intersections of spheres become intersections of hyperplanes in the lifted space—this powers efficient algorithms. Figures 3–5 (pp. 8–9) visualize the construction and show the “radical axis” as the projection of the plane intersection.

### Key Results

- **Projection characterization of curved centroids** (Theorem 1) and a **duality corollary** connecting MLE on curved exponential families to right **dual** Bregman projection of the empirical sufficient statistic onto the moment submanifold.
- **Symmetrized Bregman = curved Bregman** under the $\xi$-embedding; the symmetrized centroid is the projection of $\bar\xi$ onto $\{(\theta,\nabla F(\theta))\}$.
- **Complex circular Gaussians:** KLD equals a reverse Bregman divergence between the corresponding real-Gaussian natural parameters—hence a curved exponential-family instance.
- **α-divergences as representational curved Bregmans/Fenchel–Young** with explicit $F_\alpha$, $R_\alpha$, and duals. This directly enables geometry: nearest-neighbor data structures, smallest enclosing balls, and—highlight here—**intersection of α-divergence spheres** computed as vertical projections of the intersection of supporting hyperplanes with the epigraph of $F_\alpha$ (Proposition 3; Eq. (7)). Figures 3–5 illustrate the sphere construction and intersections.

### Strengths

- **Unifying lens.** Puts curved submanifolds, symmetrizations, and α-divergences under one Bregman-geometric roof with clean projection-based characterizations.
- **Algorithmic payoff.** The epigraph-lifting view translates α-divergence ball intersections into **linear** algebra in the lifted space (planes ∩ convex surface), making classical Bregman computational geometry usable out-of-the-box.
- **Concrete, nontrivial examples** (complex normals) demonstrate breadth beyond textbook cases.

### Improvements

- **Assumptions/regularity.** Results lean on **Legendre-type** generators and diffeomorphic embeddings; it would help to spell out failure modes (non-Legendre (F), boundaries, non-injective maps) and robustness of projections/numerics there.
- **Complexity & numerics.** The α-sphere intersection pipeline would benefit from a discussion of computational complexity and conditioning (number of spheres, ambient dimension, stability near the epigraph’s high curvature zones). Figures help intuition, but an experiment or pseudo-code would make it plug-and-play.
- **Empirical demos.** A small benchmark (e.g., computing smallest enclosing α-balls or multi-sphere intersections on synthetic categorical/simplex data) would showcase practical wins.

### What I Learned / Liked

- The **symmetrized** Bregman isn’t an alien: it’s a curved Bregman on the graph of $\nabla F$.
- **α-divergences** fall squarely into representational Bregman/Fenchel–Young form, unlocking the whole Bregman computational toolbox.
- The **epigraph picture** (Fig. 3–5) makes sphere intersections almost Euclidean again—very usable intuition.

### Summary Brief of the Paper

The paper introduces **curved Bregman divergences**—Bregman divergences restricted to nonlinear parameter submanifolds—and proves that their **centroids are right Bregman projections** of the ordinary centroid onto the submanifold. It shows that the **symmetrized Bregman divergence** and **KLD for circular complex normals** fit naturally into this framework. Extending further, it defines **representational curved Bregmans**, proves that **α-divergences** are of this type, and leverages the **epigraph lifting** view to compute **intersections of α-divergence spheres** efficiently. Figures on pp. 8–9 visualize the sphere construction and intersection geometry.

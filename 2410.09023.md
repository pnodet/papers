# Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials

[arxiv.org/2410.09023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023)

### Problem / State of the Art

Designing **isotropic photonic bandgaps** in aperiodic media is tricky: crystals make band structures predictable but inherently anisotropic, while known aperiodic candidates (quasicrystals, stealthy-hyperuniform (SHU) patterns, Vogel spirals, jammed networks) either trade off depth vs isotropy or require strong short-range order that’s not well understood. The paper asks: _what minimal structural feature robustly produces deep, isotropic gaps—especially for vector waves—and can it be realized without long-range translational order?_

### Goal

Introduce and realize a new class of correlated disordered materials—**gyromorphs**—whose structure factor has a **ring of $G$ delta-like peaks at radius $K$** but is otherwise as “liquid-like” as possible, then show they **outperform** quasicrystals, SHU, and Vogel spirals for opening **isotropic** gaps in 2D (scalar & vector) and **complete isotropic** gaps in 3D; finally, extend to **multi-ring “polygyromorphs”** to engineer multiple gaps.

### Challenges

- Achieving **quasi-long-range rotational order** without inducing translational order or hyperuniformity.
- Generating **finite-size patterns** with very **tall, narrow** peaks (delta-like) at $K$ that scale well with $N$.
- Demonstrating **isotropic** gaps for **TE (vector)** waves in 2D—historically harder than TM—and doing so with tractable simulations.
- Extending the recipe to **3D** while keeping peaks uniformly distributed on a sphere.

### Key Mechanism / Method

- **Spectral optimization with FReSCo (NUwNU variant).** Start from a random point set; impose continuous $k$-space constraints to place **$G$ high peaks (target height $N$)** on a circle (2D) or sphere (3D) at radius $K$, leaving everything else unconstrained to remain liquid-like. (Fig. 1b on p.1; method details, pp.2–3.)
- Resulting structures show:
  - **Peaks** whose **heights scale $O(GN)$** and **widths shrink $\sim 1/L$** → delta-like in the thermodynamic limit (Fig. 2b, p.2–3).
  - **Liquid-like translational order** (low-$k$ $S(k)$ saturates; number-variance scaling ~ hard disks) → **not hyperuniform** (Fig. 2a and Fig. 7, pp.2–3 & 7–8).
  - **Quasi-long-range rotational order** with a power-law decay in a $G$-mode orientational correlation $g_G(r)\sim r^{-1}$ (Fig. 10, p.9).
  - A striking **“Fourier duality”** with quasicrystals: gyromorphs’ $S(k)$ resembles quasicrystals’ $g(r)$, and vice-versa (Figs. 8–9, p.8).

- **Optics via coupled-dipoles** (Rayleigh scatterers, LDOS & transmission), using their MAGreeTe library; validate TE focus in 2D and show TM in SM; small-system FDTD checks in SM (Fig. 3 and Methods snippets on pp.3–4 & 9).

### Key Results

- **2D (TE focus; $n=3$, $\phi=5\%$).** Clear **isotropic transmission trough** and **DOS depletion** at $k_0 \approx K/2$ (Fig. 3a–d, p.3). Against matched-$K$ baselines, gyromorphs show **deeper and more isotropic gaps** than: 10-/60-fold de Bruijn quasicrystals (which trade depth for anisotropy with symmetry), SHU, and Vogel spirals (Fig. 4, p.4). Gap depth strengthens with higher index contrast and size; weak dependence on $G$.
- **3D.** With peaks uniformly spread on a sphere (icosahedral subdivisions), simulations show an **isotropic transmission gap correlated with LDOS suppression**—i.e., a **complete isotropic bandgap** in 3D (example uses $n=6.5$, $\phi=10\%$; Fig. 5b–d, p.4).
- **Polygyromorphs (multi-ring).** Imposing **three incommensurate rings** yields **three consecutive gaps** in transmission and DOS (Fig. 6a–d, p.5).

### Strengths

- **Conceptual leap:** A clean, actionable **spectral design rule**—“one ring of big peaks”—that unifies why diverse aperiodic structures can gap and pushes beyond them. (The heuristic connects to Ewald-sphere/backscattering arguments; pp.2–3.)
- **Performance:** Strong, **isotropic** gaps for **TE** in 2D—historically difficult—plus **complete 3D** gaps.
- **Scalings & order characterization:** Clear evidence of **non-hyperuniformity** and **quasi-long-range rotational order** with quantitative scaling of peak height/width and orientational correlations.
- **Generality:** **Polygyromorphs** enable **multi-gap** engineering; recipe naturally extends to 3D.

### Improvements

- **Band structure rigor:** Main gap evidence is transmission + LDOS via coupled-dipoles; more plane-wave/FDTD **band-diagram** analysis (and finite-size scaling) would nail down **complete** gaps and isolate edge vs bulk effects.
- **Fabrication realism:** Explore **size/polydispersity**, **absorption**, **index dispersion**, and **positional noise** tolerance—especially for the narrow spectral peaks that define gyromorphs.
- **Design trade-offs:** Map the **phase space** $(G, K, \phi, n, a)$ for optimal gap width/robustness; quantify **multi-ring interference** (gap interactions) and **near-field coupling** limits of the dipole model.
- **Theory:** Formalize the **quasicrystal–gyromorph duality**, and give analytic criteria for when a ring in (S(k)) guarantees an isotropic pseudogap for vector waves.

### What I Learned / Liked

- A **single isotropic ring in (S(k))** is a powerful, minimal motif for isotropic gaps; enforcing it spectrally while **keeping real-space liquid-like** is the key trick.
- The **duality with quasicrystals** clarifies why QC gaps dilute with higher symmetry while gyromorphs don’t—they “pump” spectral weight into the first ring instead of smearing it across many shells.
- **Polygyromorphs** feel like a modular frequency-planning tool for multi-band devices.

### Summary (Brief)

The paper introduces **gyromorphs**, disordered point patterns with **liquid-like translation** but **quasi-long-range $G$-fold rotation**—engineered by optimizing $S(k)$ to have **one ring of delta-like peaks** at radius $K$. These structures are **not hyperuniform**, show peak heights $\sim O(GN)$ and widths $\sim 1/L$, and exhibit **$r^{-1}$** decay in a $G$-mode rotational correlator. Using a **coupled-dipoles** model, they demonstrate **deep, isotropic** gaps in 2D (TE & TM) that **outperform quasicrystals, SHU, and Vogel spirals**, and show **complete isotropic** gaps in 3D. **Polygyromorphs** (multiple rings) produce **multiple bandgaps** within one structure, suggesting a versatile pathway to tunable, isotropic photonic devices.
